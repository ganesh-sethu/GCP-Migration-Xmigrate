```python
# Example configuration management approach
from google.cloud import run_v2
from google.cloud import container_v1
from google.cloud import compute_v1

class GCPServiceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.run_client = run_v2.ServicesClient()
        self.gke_client = container_v1.ClusterManagerClient()
        self.compute_client = compute_v1.InstancesClient()
    
    def deploy_cloudrun_service(self, config):
        # Programmatic Cloud Run deployment
        pass
    
    def configure_networking(self, vpc_config):
        # VPC and firewall configuration
        pass
    
    def setup_keycloak_integration(self, auth_config):
        # Authentication setup
        pass
```

## Conclusion

**For your specific requirements**, Cloud Run emerges as the optimal starting point due to its excellent cost efficiency, strong GitHub Actions integration, and adequate networking capabilities. However, consider GKE for complex authentication architectures or when you need maximum networking control. A hybrid approach using Cloud Run for application services and GKE/Compute Engine for Keycloak infrastructure provides the best balance of cost, functionality, and flexibility.
